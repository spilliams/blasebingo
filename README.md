# The Adventure Zone Bingo!

This is a small project by [@jrfbz](https://twitter.com/jrfbz) and [@spilliams](@https://twitter.com/spilliams).

It has one deployment: here, on github pages. This is managed through the CNAME file and some DNS on the domain side.

To test locally, try `python -m http.server`
